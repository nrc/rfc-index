# RFC index

VERY WIP

A curated index of Rust RFCs.

This project has three parts:

* a website for browsing Rust RFCs,
* [metadata](/metadata) for that website,
* [a CLI app](/src) for editing the above metadata and generating the website.

## Building and running

You'll need to get a GitHub personal access token and put it in a file called token.in in the root of this repo at compile time.
